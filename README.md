# Crowd2Map Tanzania

We are working with worldwide volunteers & locals in Tanzania to improve the maps of rural regions - maps are essential to support development and humanitarian efforts in the country, particularly in protecting girls from female genital mutilation (FGM), ensuring they get quality education and can continue to shape their own futures.

### Why are we mapping?

Better maps is one of the key steps towards humanitarian, developmental efforts in the country, as well as improving everyday lives of locals. By literally putting rural settlements on the map, and mapping out roads that lead to them, we make sure that even the most remote places are recognized and reachable. Moreover, the locals benefit from the easily accesible information that is crucial in everyday lives, such as where are working water points, schools, hospitals and so on.

By mapping particular objects (e.g. schools) we can help governments and humanitarian organizations visualize the situation in the country (e.g. do all villages have easy access to schools?), which helps support developmental efforts.

Most importantly, our current focus lies on female genital mutilation (FGM) and saving more girls from the life-threatening practice in rural Tanzania. We are working with Mugumu Safe House to enable outreach in the villages of the region of Mara, and letting the girls know where and how they can see help. Without maps it is impossible to know where are remote villages or settlemenets, where are there roads or bridges leading up to them, do fuel planning, and inform girls about the location of the Safe House.

### How are we mapping?

1. **Satellite mapping** - volunteers worldwide can contribute to the project by doing mapping at openstreetmap.org. Currently we are working on this task: http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1788. All you need to contribute is an openstreetmap.org account.

2. **Local mapping "on the ground"** - locals in Tanzania are encouraged to map their own communities via Maps.me app. Often the knowledge of rural areas, even the correct locations and names of the villages are limited to local knowledge only. We incentivize locals to map their areas, by running regular competitions with monetary prizes for the most added points. Here are the Maps.me points added in Tanzania: http://mmwatch.osmz.ru/?country=Tanzania
