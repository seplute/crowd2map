# Crowd2Map Tanzania

We are working with worldwide volunteers & locals in Tanzania to improve the maps of rural regions - maps are essential to support development and humanitarian efforts in the country, particularly in protecting girls from female genital mutilation (FGM), ensuring they get quality education and can continue to shape their own futures.
